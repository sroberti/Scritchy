# Scritchy
A fast and simple scratchpad tool for handwritten notes. Essentially, this program is designed to mimic the convenience of a sticky note via a stylus and touchscreen.  

## Design Goals
Extremely minimal interface.  Every bit of functionality should be accessible to the user via the stylus.  Simple gesture controls should be favored over onscreen buttons.

Versatile customization via command line and local configuration files.  Scritchy should be run via scripts or hotkeys, with exact functionality determined by static configuration rather than complicated in-app menus.

Export to image format (PNG, JPG, BMP, etc) and/or a text format that stores the sequence of user inputs, allowing later playback or modification.

Compatibility.  Currently, Scritchy is developed on a Thinkpad x220t running Ubuntu, so that's all it will support until other features are working.
